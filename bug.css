The following CSS code snippet attempts to style an element with a background image, but it fails to apply correctly due to a typographical error in the `url()` function.  The correct syntax requires double quotes around the URL path.

```css
.my-element {
  background-image: url(my-image.jpg);
}
```

The error manifests as the background image not appearing as expected.
